To ensure your new tattoo heals beautifully and lasts a lifetime, please follow these aftercare guidelines carefully:\n\nâ€¢ Keep the tattooed area clean and dry for the first 7 days.\nâ€¢ Always wash your hands thoroughly before touching your tattoo.\nâ€¢ Clean the tattoo using dry tissue only. Avoid cotton, wet tissues, towels, or cloths, as they may irritate the area or introduce bacteria.\n\nâ€¢ Apply a thin layer of a fragrance-free, alcohol-free moisturizer or tattoo-specific aftercare cream only before bathing. Keep the area dry throughout the day.\n\nâ€¢ After 7 days, moisturize the tattooed area twice daily using the recommended gel or ointment.\n\nâ€¢ Avoid wearing tight or abrasive clothing that may rub against the tattoo.\nâ€¢ Do not soak the tattoo in water â€” avoid baths, hot tubs, pools, and prolonged swimming sessions.\nâ€¢ Refrain from strenuous activities or workouts that may cause excessive sweating or friction in the tattooed area.\n\nâ€¢ Protect the tattoo from exposure to harsh chemicals such as chlorine, bleach, or cleaning agents.\n\nâ€¢ Do not pick, scratch, or peel any scabs or flaking skin that may appear during the healing process.\n\nâ€¢ Follow any personalized aftercare advice provided by your tattoo artist for best results.\n\nâ€¢ If you observe any signs of infection â€” such as persistent redness, swelling, warmth, or discharge â€” contact your tattoo artist or a healthcare professional immediately.\n\nâ€”\n\nINK ATELIER\nYour skin is our canvas.
